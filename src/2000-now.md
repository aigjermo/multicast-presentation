# Further problems with MBone

--------

Multicast networks have had a flat topology, built out of tunnels between
nodes in different ASs, leading to a number of problems.

## Scalability

Large number of routes became a big problem for MBone, peaking at over 10k routes

To manage larger networks, route aggregation and hierachical routing is needed

## Manageability

Lack of central management and formal procedures has resulted in many cases of
sub-optimal routing:

> * Many tunnels routed over the same links.
> * Routing problems spreading across the topology due to lack of border protection.

# Inter-domain routing


# IP vs Overlay vs Application layer
