## Multicast is old!


## Stephen Deering

introduces the first concrete ideas about multicast in his Ph.D. dissertation

. . .

One year before Tim Berners-Lee's proposals for the World Wide Web.


# 1992

## First wide scale test

Audiocast from the IETF meeting in San Diego over MBone.

. . .

World Wide Web still has less than 100 pages.

### `mrouted`

* Application layer implementation running on connected workstations
* Traffic routed through unicast-encapsulated tunnels between members

Early MBone network

### "Broadcast and prune"

> * Source sends on all interfaces
> * Routers do RPF checks on incoming traffic
>     * Drop traffic if RPF fails
>     * Or respond with prune msg
> * Edge/leaf discover group members through IGMP
>     * Forward traffic to members
>     * Or respond with prune msg
> * Routers receiving prune msgs on all interfaces, will forward towards source

--------

### DVMRP

*Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol*

Used broadcast and prune, but:

* No pruning at all in the beginning
* RPF checks on neighbors to select output interfaces


# 1994

## Major video broadcast

of a concert with The Rolling Stones


# ~1995

## MBone is expanding

* links appearing in Russia & Antarctica
* Hardware support & new protocols

--------

### MOSPF

*Multicast extensions for Open Shortest Path First*

* Broadcasts group membership info within an AS.
    * Allows each router to have a complete picture.
    * Requires more state to be maintained per router.
* Shortest path trees are build using Dijkstra for each group.
* Data is only sent to group members.

# 1998

## vBNS collapses

when MBone is flooded with tens of gigabits of traffic during a Internet2
member meeting in San Francisco.

. . .

vBNS engineers start rolling out *PIM-SM*.


## PIM-SM

*Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode*
